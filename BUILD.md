# Building

## Requirements

    A working brain
    Console/terminal/shell access

(okay, real requirements:)

- Git
- Java JDK 7+ (JDK8 will build it, but is not really recommended by Legend Arena's devs.)

## Actually Building

If you don't have Gradle installed (awesome builder, btw), replace **gradle** with **./gradlew** on \*nix systems (or if you use Git Bash), or **gradlew.bat** on Windows systems.

(or if you use windows feel free to just use "gradlew" - that's actually pretty neat but still kind of strange.. I guess)

    gradle build

If you want JavaDocs:

    gradle javadoc

# And, finally...

Enjoy having built a Legend Arena jar.
