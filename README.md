Legend Arena Plugin
====

This holds all the source code for the Legend Arena plugin.

Also, if IntelliJ complains about ```Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers()``` being ambigous - get the Spigot API jar.

Also, for this to build properly, get the annotations.jar and gson jar. The jars can be found in the lib.zip file.
In IntelliJ, for each jar, add "Extracted Directory" for both jar. Otherwise, it will not work!
