## Legend Arena [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/LegendArenaMC/LegendArena/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/LegendArenaMC/LegendArena/latest)

The Legend Arena plugins are Bukkit plugins made for Legend Arena.

## Current Plugin List

* Legend Arena (you're here!)
* [Never Have I Ever](https://github.com/LegendArenaMC/NeverHaveIEver)

### License

The entire Legend Arena plugin source code is licensed under the MIT License.

### Building

```
./build.sh
```

Done.

Or, get a pre-built jar from the Drone.IO builds. (click on the build status image at the top of this README)

And no, there will not be a Windows batch file. If you really need to build the plugin on Windows, just manually run the correct commands to build it.

(or use Cygwin/Git Bash)
