Post Notes

I am aware the code isn't as neat as it could be; I will work on improving it, but for now it will (sadly) have to be this way. Sorry!

While we are getting the frameworking done, debug mode will be permanently on. If you don't like it that way, remember:

- We are in public alpha as a minigames server
- There is currently a core one-man team working on the entire plugin (on a laptop with 2G of RAM, mind you)
- We are not fully launched, and thus we basically can mess things up and probably no one would care (again; public alpha is public alpha)

YOU NEED JAVA 1.8 TO USE THIS. So unless you want to do massive rewrites to support Java 6, you'll need Java 8. Sorry!
(please note: re-writing this to support Java 7 wouldn't be too bad, just quite a lot of files to go through)
