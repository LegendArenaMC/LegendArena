## Building

```
./build.sh
```

Done.

Or, get a pre-built jar from the CircleCI builds. (click on the build status image at the top of this README)

And no, there will not be a Windows batch file. If you really need to build the plugin on Windows, just manually run the correct commands to build it.

(or use Cygwin/Git Bash)
